    <p> <em>E = mc2, equation in German-born physicist Albert Einsteinâ€™s theory of special relativity that expresses the fact that mass and energy are the same physical entity and can be changed into each other. In the equation, the increased relativistic mass (m) of a body times the speed of light squared (c2) is equal to the kinetic energy (E) of that body.</em></p>
